# Chatbot_AI
A chatbot AI that learns your personality and mimics you.

*** HOW TO USE ***
When you first launch the program it will create a file called "brain." This is where all the chatbot's knowledge of language is stored.

When the AI comes across a phrase or a word it doesn't yet know, it will simply repeat it back at the user. This is because it is waiting to see how the user would respond to it.
Once the user returns a message, the AI will remember that is the appropriate response.

Through this system, the AI will eventually learn a language and seem to mimic a real person.

*** PROBLEMS ***

The AI does not have any real understanding of what is going on in the conversation at any moment. It simply remembers many different types of responses and keeps records of all the conversations it has ever had.
In the future, I plan to give it a more complex brain, rather than just parroting human language.
